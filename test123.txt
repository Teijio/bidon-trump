Will Hurd on Thursday launched a bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, joining a crowded field looking to challenge front-runner former President Donald Trump. \"This is a decision that my wife and I decided to do because we live in complicated times and we need common sense,\" Hurd, who was an undercover CIA officer before entering politics, said on CBS. \"There are a number of generational defining challenges that we're faced with in the United States of America -- everything from the Chinese government trying to surpass us as the global superpower, the fact that inflation is persistent at a time when technologies like artificial intelligence is going to upend every single industry, and our kids, their scores in math, science and reading are the lowest they've ever been in this century,\" the former congressman said.  \"These are the issues we should be talking about. And to be frank, I'm pissed that we're not talking about these things,\" Hurd added. Hurd has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump following the former president's indictment on federal charges over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges.Â  \"Too many of these candidates in this race are afraid of Donald Trump,\" Hurd said of the GOP primary field.  Besides Trump, Republican presidential contenders also include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and conservative talk radio host Larry Elder.    Hurd said that, if elected to the White House, he would not pardon Trump should the former president be convicted, adding that he thought it was \"insane\" that other candidates were open to the idea.  Ramaswamy has committed to pardoning Trump if he's elected president. Haley, Suarez and Elder have also suggested they would be inclined to do so.  Hurd said Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents \"spits in the face of the thousands of men and women who every single day and every single night put themselves in harm's way in order to keep us safe. And so to me that's unacceptable.\" Hurd was a rare Republican critic of Trump during his time in Congress from 2015 to 2021. Representing a swing district in Texas that covered the largest stretch of the US-Mexico border of any congressional seat, he opposed Trump's border wall and argued it was less effective than other forms of border security.   Hurd was one of four House Republicans in 2019 to vote in support of a resolution condemning Trump's racist tweets targeting four Democratic congresswomen of color. He also authored a New York Times op-ed in 2018 arguing that Trump was being manipulated by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite his outspoken criticism, Hurd said in 2019 that he would vote for Trump the following year were he to be the GOP nominee.   Hurd had been fueling speculation about a potential presidential run with trips to early-voting primary states in recent months. Hurd was in New Hampshire last week and told local station WMUR 9 he was evaluating whether his candidacy would have a path to the GOP nomination. In January, he spoke at the annual meeting of the New Hampshire Republican Party -- the same event where Trump kicked off his 2024 campaigning. Hurd also visited Iowa for the Faith and Freedom Coalition's spring event that included several other 2024 GOP hopefuls. Hurd was the only Black Republican in the House when he announced in 2019 that he would not seek reelection and instead pursue opportunities outside government to \"solve problems at the nexus between technology and national security.\" Hurd served in the CIA for almost a decade before coming to Congress. As a congressman, he served on the House Intelligence Committee, which is charged with oversight of the US intelligence community.   Hurd first ran for Congress in 2010, losing to Quico Canseco in a runoff for the GOP nomination. Four years later, Hurd defeated Canseco, by then a former congressman, in another primary runoff before narrowly unseating Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego in the general election. He was narrowly reelected in 2016 and 2018, defeating Gallego and Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, respectively.

Modi, massively popular in India, has demonstrated a drift toward authoritarianism that has worried the West. He's cracked down on dissent, targeted journalists and introduced policies that human rights groups say discriminate against Muslims.  Yet Modi and India, the world's largest democracy, also represent a lynchpin in Biden's strategy in Asia. The country recently surpassed China to become the most populous country on Earth. No major global challenge, from climate change to advances in technology, can be addressed without India's buy-in, in Biden's view. And in an era of growing tensions between the US and China, there are few partners that Biden is more eager to cultivate. That, according to officials, was the rationale behind inviting Modi for a state visit, only the third of Biden's presidency so far.  And so, on Thursday the prime minister was welcomed to the White House with the highest trappings of American friendship: Marching troops on the South Lawn, extensive Oval Office talks and a state dinner in the evening, complete with a chef who specializes in plant-based cuisine to accommodate Modi's vegetarian diet. After the elaborate welcome ceremony, Biden hailed the friendship between the US and India. But he also sought to underscore the importance of shared values in the relationship moving forward. \"As democracies, we canÂ better tap into the fullÂ talent of all of our people,Â and attract investments as true and trusted partnersÂ as leading nations, with ourÂ greatest export being the powerÂ of our example,\" Biden said from a podium on the South Lawn. \"Equity under the law, freedom ofÂ expression, religious pluralismÂ and the diversity of our people.Â These core principles haveÂ endured and evolved even as theyÂ have faced challenges throughout each ofÂ our nation's histories and fuelÂ our strength, depth and future.\" The two leaders will hold a joint news conference -- something virtually every state visit over the past two decades has featured -- but that was only agreed upon after lengthy, delicate negotiations between the two sides. Indian officials initially balked at the White House's insistence, two US officials familiar with the matter said. The ask was unwelcome territory for Modi, who does not hold news conferences in India, where press freedom groups say he's overseen a crackdown on reporting. Indian officials had instead pushed for joint statements after which the two leaders would take no questions. It was only on the eve of Modi's visit that Indian officials agreed to a compromise: the leaders would hold a \"one-and-one,\" calling on one reporter from each side rather than the traditional \"two-and-two,\" during which each leader would call on two reporters from their press corps. \"We're just grateful that Prime Minister Modi is going to be participating in a press event at the end of the visit. We think that's important and we're glad that he thinks that's important too,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday when asked about the negotiations. The Indian Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thursday's state visit is aimed at strengthening what national security adviser Jake Sullivan has billed as \"one of the defining relationships of the 21st century.\" The meetings are expected to produce agreements on technology and defense cooperation and highlight Biden's efforts to shore up relationships in a region grappling with an increasingly aggressive Beijing. Also up for discussion is likely to be Russia's continuing war in Ukraine, a conflict on which India has not taken a definitive side. New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil has helped prop up Moscow amid withering global sanctions. \"Fundamentally, we believe that the long-term trajectory of the US-India relationship is built on the notion that two democracies with shared value systems ought to be able to work together,\" Sullivan told a group of reporters ahead of the visit.  \"That's a long view. That's a view rooted in our bet on the relationship between the people of the United States of America and the people of India,\" Sullivan continued. \"Part of what will be lifted up and celebrated in this visit will be those deep people and people ties.\" Courting a controversial leader Modi is hardly the first leader with authoritarian tendencies to be invited for a state visit at the White House. President Barack Obama hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, shortly after he assumed power in Beijing. And Biden is not the first president to embrace Modi. Alongside President Donald Trump, the Indian prime minister attended a massive \"Howdy Modi\" rally in Houston for members of the Indian diaspora. Modi returned the favor in Ahmedabad with a \"Namaste Trump\" event held in the world's largest cricket stadium. Other world leaders have offered a similar welcome. French President Emmanuel Macron will host Modi as the guest of honor at this year's Bastille Day parade. But Biden has made as a centerpiece of his foreign policy the battle between \"democracy and autocracy,\" a thematic backdrop perhaps nowhere more relevant than in India. In March, the former leader of India's main opposition political party, Rahul Gandhi, was disqualified as a lawmaker a day after he was handed a two-year jail sentence for defamation in a ruling his supporters called politically motivated. Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has come under scrutiny from rights groups and opposition lawmakers for its increasingly strident brand of Hindu nationalist politics and an ongoing crackdown on dissent. Modi himself was denied a visa to the United States in 2005 because of his alleged role in anti-Muslim violence three years earlier in Gujarat state, where he was chief minister. More than 1,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims. A Supreme Court-ordered investigation in India absolved him of blame. A wide array of human rights groups, lawmakers and dissidents have made clear they want Biden to raise his concerns on Modi's record when he's at the White House. A group of more than 70 congressional Democrats wrote a letter to Biden this week urging him to bring up human rights concerns when he meets with Modi. \"You have once again made respect for human rights, press freedom, religious freedom, and pluralism core tenets of American foreign policy. Moreover, these tenets are necessary to the functioning of true democracy. In order to advance these values with credibility on the world stage, we must apply them equally to friend and foe alike, just as we work to apply these same principles here in the United States,\" the lawmakers wrote.  The letter was spearheaded by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat. Jayapal said in a tweet about the letter, \"We must ensure freedom of the press, religious tolerance, internet access, & the diversity of political thought.\" Modi is set to address Congress as part of his visit; three members of Congress, Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have said they will boycott in protest of Modi's treatment of Muslims. Sullivan said the president intends to speak about human rights and democratic values in both public and private settings. \"Any time we see challenges with respect to press freedom, religious freedom, infringements on the democracy space, we make our views known,\" he said. Grappling with China's influence Thursday's state visit will include announcements in the technology space as well as defense cooperation, including on defense sales, production and technology collaboration, an administration official said. The administration official noted that American defense trade with India had boomed in the past 15 years and noted that India is diversifying away from relying on any one nation, like Russia, for arms.  \"You'll see major cancellations of defense system purchases from Russia, in part because we know Russia can't actually provide it, that Russia is consuming its own defense production very quickly in this terrible war in Ukraine,\" the official said. \"And everyone around the world who buys Russian equipment is worried about whether they can get spare parts and then new systems, given the supply chain problems that Russia is experiencing.\" Among the announcements expected when the two leaders meet Thursday is that India has committed to the purchase of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones, deepening the two nations' military ties amidst the backdrop of an increasingly bellicose China. Biden and Modi will also welcome news of an \"unprecedented ... next generation defense partnership,\" between the two nations, touting an agreement between US manufacturer GE and the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics to jointly produce F414 jet engines in India, an official told reporters on a call previewing the state visit Wednesday.  Other expected announcements are that India will be joining the US-led Artemis Accords, an international cooperative agreement for space exploration, mounting a joint-mission with NASA to the International Space Station in 2024 and a commitment from US-based semiconductor producer Micron Technology to break ground on a $2.75 billion new semiconductor assembly and test facility in India. The discussions between the two men will also touch on enhancing educational exchanges and are expected to feature new steps forward on visas and diplomatic presence in each country.  They will also discuss agenda issues for the G20 summit, which India is preparing to host in September. Biden's efforts to deepen ties with India comes as the two countries grapple with the growing influence of China. The president has met with Modi on several occasions, including through meetings of the Quad leaders. He said at a fundraiser this week that his revival of the four-way alliance had upset Xi. \"He called me and told me not to do that because it was putting him in a bind,\" Biden said, referring to the Chinese president. \"We're just trying to make sure the international rules of air and sea lanes remain open.\" Sullivan, however, said Thursday's visit at the White House was \"not about China,\" though \"the question of China's role in the military domain, the technology domain, the economic domain will be on the agenda.\" This story has been updated with additional reporting.
